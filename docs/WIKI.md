### PEG Ratio (Price-Earnings to Growth Ratio)

The PEG ratio is a valuation metric that compares a company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to its earnings growth rate. This gives investors a way to see if they are paying too much or too little for a stock relative to its potential growth.

The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) trailing twelve months (TTM) ratio tells you how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings.

```
P/E Ratio (TTM) = Price per Share / Earnings per Share (TTM)
```

Where `Price per Share` is the current price of a stock, `Earnings per Share (TTM)` is the company's profit divided by the number of outstanding shares over the trailing twelve months.

The Annual Earnings per Share Growth Rate (Annual EPS Growth or Earnings Growth Rate) tells you how much a company's earnings are growing year over year.

```
Annual EPS Growth = (Current EPS - Previous EPS) / Previous EPS * 100
```

Where `Current EPS` is the most recent earnings per share, `Previous EPS` is the earnings per share from the previous year, `100` is used to convert the result to a percentage.

By comparing the two, you can see if a stock is overvalued or undervalued.

```
PEG Ratio = P/E Ratio / Earnings Growth Rate
```

A PEG ratio of 1 typically suggests that a stock is fairly valued, meaning its price reflects its expected earnings growth. A PEG ratio below 1 might indicate that a stock is undervalued, while a ratio above 1 could suggest it's overvalued.

## Technical Analysis

> "There is one thing that technical analysis cannot do, and that is predict the future. Technical analysis can only identify the probabilities of future price movements based on past behavior." - John Murphy

- Technical Analysis - is the study of market action, primarily through the use of charts, for the purspose of forecasting future price trends.
- Market Action - includes the three principal sources of information - price, voulme, and open interest. (Open interest is used only in futures and options.)
- Philosophy of Rationale - market action discounts everything (anything that can possibly affect the price - fundamentally, politically, psycologically, or otherwise - is actually reflected in the price of that market); prices move in trends. 
- Chart - The underlying forces of supply and demand, the economic fundamentals of a market, that cause bull and bear markets. The charts do not in themselves cause markets to move up or down. The charts simply refelect the bullish or bearish psycology of the market.
- Market Makers - are financial intermediaries who ensure liquidity in financial markets by providing liquidity, reducing price volatility, ensuring market efficiency. Their main activities include: quote Bid and Ask Prices, hold and maintain securities, facilitate trades, and hedge risks (options, futures, etc.).
- Descriptive statistics - the graphical presentation of data, such as the price data on a standard bar chart. 
- Inductive statistics - generalizations, predictions, or extrapolations that are inferred from the data. 
- Uptrend - is a situation in which each successive really close higher than the previous really high, and each successive rally low also closes higher than the previous rally low. in other words, an uptrend has a pattern of rising peaks and troughs. 
- Downtrend - is the opposite to the uptrend, with successively lower peaks and troughs.
